A long time ago, I read an article about someone who *bred* programs on their
dev machine. They reproduced sexually and eventually eventually evolved ways to
kill each other off.

In nature, organisms need to use energy, maintain homeostasis, and
reproduce. All three criteria can be considered to be met a standard computer
program.

However, they don't generally change, nor do they generally have an instinct to
reproduce themselves as much as possible.

We'll need to create a framework in which for these digital organisms to live.
Let's give them a rudimentary task to perform. They'll need to do it as quickly
as possible and submit the answer. The input will be written into the process's
address space before it is started and it will be expected to write the output
to a particular location when it exits.

A parent process will manage many of these organisms. It will start N of them
for each generation, allowing them to run concurrently. The top M will be bred
together to form the next generation.

We'll start with a simple task and ensure that there are degrees of success to
the task.

Okay, so I'm thinking about the method of communication between the parent and
the child. Shared memory is by far the simples method to use. Unfortunately, a
fork+exec wouldn't work because the exec would wipe out the shared memory.

So what if I didn't use exec? We wouldn't package each organism as an ELF.
Instead, it would just be a "function". The environment would read each genome
in a different thread in the environment process. Each thread would wait on a
wait group for them all to finish, then, all at once, we'd jump to the first
instruction in the genome. Once the task is finished, the organism must signal
the environment that it is finished. A manager thread will notice that the
organism has finished and record the result.

How about this? What if we have a separate concurrent process (or thread?)
monitoring the output of each organism. If it has not made sufficient progress
on its task, then the this god process kills the organism. This God process
would need to be memory protected from the organisms so that they couldn't just
learn how to kill *it*.
